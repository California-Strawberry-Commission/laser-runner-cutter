This project integrates tracking code from [ByteTrack](https://github.com/FoundationVision/ByteTrack.git), licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. \
Specifically, the code cloned and referenced is from the [TensorRT C++ Deployment](https://github.com/FoundationVision/ByteTrack/tree/main/deploy/TensorRT/cpp)

NOTES:
 - test_loop should work properly, but ensure the image frames fed into it make sense as video feed
 - Also, this branch has the next app subscribe to the hardcoded detection_node/overlayFrame
